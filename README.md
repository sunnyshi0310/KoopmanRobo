## üß† Overview

This tutorial is designed for both **beginners** and **researchers** interested in applying Koopman operator theory to robotic systems.  
It walks you through the **entire pipeline** ‚Äî from raw data collection to Koopman-based model estimation, controller design, and practical implementation.

All the main steps are demonstrated in **[`demo.ipynb`](demo.ipynb)**, which you can run directly to reproduce the results.  
The notebook provides detailed comments, visualizations, and practical notes to help you understand not only *how* but also *why* each step works.

## üß© What You‚Äôll Learn

In the tutorial, you will:
- Collect and preprocess robot motion data  
- Estimate a Koopman operator model purely from data  
- Design a **Koopman-based Model Predictive Controller (MPC)** for a differential drive robot  
- Visualize and evaluate the performance of the learned controller  
- Understand how changing the **lifting function dictionary**, **MPC parameters**, or **training data** affects performance  

The implementation emphasizes clarity and educational value ‚Äî the code is intentionally simple and not optimized for performance.  
We encourage readers to extend and experiment further.
