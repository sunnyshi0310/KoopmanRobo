# KoopmanRobo

This repository includes the Python and Matlab implementations of the tutorial introduced in the survey paper
1.   Lu Shi, Masih Haseli, Daniel Bruder, Ian Abraham, Todd David Murphey, Jorge Cortes, and Konstantinos Karydis, "Koopman Operator Theory in
Foundational Robotics Research", In Process

The tutorial and scripts provided here are friendly to those who are new to the Koopman operator theory in Robotics. It mainly focused on clarifying the whole process, including data collection, model estimation, controller design and practical implementation. Note that the code is not optimized and is naive. We highly recommend advanced investigations of this area with the following resources.

1. Pykoopman: Compare the effect of dictionary selections and test different approaches to estimate the Koopman operator.
2. Koopman_learning_and_control: Koopman with different controllers and implementations.
3. Active-learning-koopman: Koopman with active learning (improved data-collection process).
